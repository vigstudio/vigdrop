- Return meaningful error messages to clients

## WebSocket Communication

- Handle connection errors gracefully
- Implement proper cleanup on disconnection

## Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement file size limits
- Check file types before upload
- No sensitive data in logs

## Testing

- Verify file transfers work across different devices
- Check browser compatibility
