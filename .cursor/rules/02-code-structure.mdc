# Code Structure Guide

## Backend Architecture

The backend is built with Node.js and uses the following structure:

- [server.js](mdc:server.js)
  - WebSocket server setup
  - HTTP endpoints for file transfers
  - Device management logic
  
- [database.js](mdc:database.js)
  - SQLite database operations
  - Device persistence
  - Connection tracking

## Frontend Organization

The frontend assets are located in the [public/](mdc:public) directory:

- HTML/CSS for the user interface
- JavaScript for real-time communication
- Assets and icons

## Data Flow

1. Device Discovery
   - Devices connect via WebSocket
   - Server maintains active device list
   - Clients receive updates about nearby devices

2. File Transfer
   - Sender uploads file to server
   - Server notifies recipient
   - Recipient downloads file
   - Server cleans up temporary files
